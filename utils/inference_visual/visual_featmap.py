    """Draw featmap.

    - If `overlaid_image` is not None, the final output image will be the
      weighted sum of img and featmap.

    - If `resize_shape` is specified, `featmap` and `overlaid_image`
      are interpolated.

    - If `resize_shape` is None and `overlaid_image` is not None,
      the feature map will be interpolated to the spatial size of the image
      in the case where the spatial dimensions of `overlaid_image` and
      `featmap` are different.

    - If `channel_reduction` is "squeeze_mean" and "select_max",
      it will compress featmap to single channel image and weighted
      sum to `overlaid_image`.

    - If `channel_reduction` is None

      - If topk <= 0, featmap is assert to be one or three
        channel and treated as image and will be weighted sum
        to ``overlaid_image``.
      - If topk > 0, it will select topk channel to show by the sum of
        each channel. At the same time, you can specify the `arrangement`
        to set the window layout.

    Args:
        featmap (torch.Tensor): The featmap to draw which format is
            (C, H, W).
        overlaid_image (np.ndarray, optional): The overlaid image.
            Defaults to None.
        channel_reduction (str, optional): Reduce multiple channels to a
            single channel. The optional value is 'squeeze_mean'
            or 'select_max'. Defaults to 'squeeze_mean'.
        topk (int): If channel_reduction is not None and topk > 0,
            it will select topk channel to show by the sum of each channel.
            if topk <= 0, tensor_chw is assert to be one or three.
            Defaults to 20.
        arrangement (Tuple[int, int]): The arrangement of featmap when
            channel_reduction is not None and topk > 0. Defaults to (4, 5).
        resize_shape (tuple, optional): The shape to scale the feature map.
            Defaults to None.
        alpha (Union[int, List[int]]): The transparency of featmap.
            Defaults to 0.5.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: RGB image.
